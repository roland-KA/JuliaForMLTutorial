# JuliaForMLTutorial

I have published in *Towards Data Science* the following tutorial that shows how Julia and its ecosystem can be used for Machine Learning:
- [Part I - *Analyzing the Glass dataset*](https://towardsdatascience.com/part-i-analyzing-the-glass-dataset-c556788a496f) concentrates on how data can be preprocessed, analyzed and visualized using packages like `ScientificTypes`, `DataFrames`, `StatsBase` and `StatsPlots`.
- [Part II - *Using a Decision Tree*](https://towardsdatascience.com/part-ii-using-a-decision-tree-ddffa4004e47) focuses on the core of the ML workflow: How to choose a model and how to use it for training, predicting and evaluating. This part relies mainly on the package `MLJ (= Machine Learning in Julia).
- Part III - *If things are not 'ready to use'* (which will be published soon) explains how easy it is to create your own solution with a few lines of code, if the packages available don't offer all the functionality you need.

In this repository you find for each of the three parts a Pluto notebook (in `notebooks`) with all code examples used in the tutorial.
